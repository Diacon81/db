Databases.Individual project by Ainhoa.

This repository contains exercises and scripts related to a MongoDB individual project focused on manipulating databases, collections, and documents. MongoDB is a powerful NoSQL database that stores data in flexible JSON-like documents, making it well-suited for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.

Description.-
The project involves working with three collections: artists, albums, and songs, each with specific fields to represent different aspects of music data.

Collections.-
• Artists: contains information about artists, including their name and genre. 
• Albums: stores data of albums, such as title, release year, and the associated artist's ID. 
• Songs: holds details of songs, including title, duration, and the album ID they belong to.

Features.-
• Use of MongoDB Compass: the exercises were performed using MongoDB Compass for visual data manipulation. 
• Data Manipulation: the project demonstrates how to insert, update, query, and delete data in MongoDB collections. 
• Presentation in Jupyter Notebook: Jupyter Notebook was chosen for the final development and orderly, coherent, and attractive presentation of the project. 
• Export of Results: exercise results were exported in JSON format for documentation and analysis. 
• Incorporation of Images: various images have been added to visually showcase the details of the exercises.

Conclusion.-
This project provides a hands-on experience with MongoDB, from initial data exploration to the final presentation in an interactive environment like Jupyter Notebook. The use of tools such as MongoDB Compass and Jupyter Notebook enables an effective combination of data visualization, analysis, and presentation, facilitating the understanding and learning of MongoDB and NoSQL databases in general. Furthermore, the combination and presentation of the project have been designed and planned with the main objective of optimization in mind, whether it's queries, performance, or efficiency in operations. It was an area that required experimentation and fine-tuning.
